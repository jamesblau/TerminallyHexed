Tests
  now
    load scenario
    print scenario
  later
    integration
      load, pass inputs, draw, compare

Notes
  break up TODO

Refactor
  add Scenario param frames: List[List[String]]
    List[Board] with type alias
    list of boards to print
      normally just one updated board to print
        but multiple for animations
          e.g. movement
            avoid placing character on intermediate tiles along path
              adds complication
                e.g. coins must remain on intermediate tiles
    check for and print all in TerminallyHexed
      clear as printed
  break up Scenario
    mapEntity etc.
    conversions
      e.g. allHexes => hexes
      implicits?
    graph
      concomps
    debug
    draw
    keep?
      actions like move(entity)
  automatically generate walls
    wherever edge is missing

State
  replace hexes as primary state
    allHexes?
    rc2AllHexes?
    rc2Thing?
      see below
  replace adjes?
    edge2Asset?
      allows removing rc from hex?
  remove *everything* from hex?
    primary
      rc2Thing
        Thing subclasses:
          Entity
          Obstacle etc.
          Door
      edge2EdgeAsset
        or just edges/adjes?
          (
            things.asset ++
            adjes.toEdges.map(pick asset based on nodes)
          ).draw
    secondary
      construct each time
        things
        nodes
        edges
      "all" and "revealed" versions
        nodes and allNodes, etc.
    how to build fromString?
      probably more annoying than difficult
  edge.neighbors?
    edgeajde?
